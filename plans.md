# Plans:
Figure out the formula of 2d6+2 (2 dice with 6 side + 2)  
Dice sizes are 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100  

we can do "random.randint(1,dicesize)" to figure out the roll result of each die our algorythm is

> # step 1 number dice
> # step 2 dice size
> # random result of step 2 on a single die ran again equal to the number of times that we have dice
> # add the value of all the rolls
> # add out modifier to that value
> # print result

We need to figure out out python figures out local variables for steps 1 and 2, then we need to figure out how python does math. Seems simple enough, we'll find out
